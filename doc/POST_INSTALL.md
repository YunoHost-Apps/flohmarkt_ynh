## finishing setup

To finish your flohmarkt setup you'll need to finish the initialization process at its setup URL.

See below the configuration tab in the ðŸ”§ wrench section to find the setup URL.

In case of problems with the configuration panel you can find the setup URL in flohmarkts logfile in /var/log/__APP__/app.log if you look for entries like this. To get the entry into the logfile you should at least open your flohmarkt web page once at [https://__DOMAIN__/](https://__DOMAIN__/).

```
2024-05-06 16:30:24 Flohmarkt is not initialized yet. Please go to 
2024-05-06 16:30:24                 https://__DOMAIN__/setup/SECRET
2024-05-06 16:30:24                 in order to complete the setup process
```
(SECRET is a random string)
